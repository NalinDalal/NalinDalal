## My Story: Building With Heart

Iâ€™m Nalin, a 21 year old engineer, builder, and relentless optimist. My story isnâ€™t just about code, itâ€™s about curiosity and a deep desire to make a difference.

As a kid, I always wondered how things actually work. That same curiosity drives me today: I want to know how things work, and more importantly, how I can make them work better for people.

Iâ€™ve faced my share of setbacks which are failed projects, bugs at 3am, ideas that didnâ€™t land. But every challenge has been a lesson in resilience. I donâ€™t give up.
Man has to learn, reapply and come back stronger. The best solution is to just build the stuff.

What makes me different?
I just want to solve problems that people actually care about and helps the human, and technology is providing me that way.

If youâ€™re looking for someone to hire, letâ€™s talk, surely I will learn a thing or two from you.
Iâ€™m here to build things that matter, with people who care.
