## My Story: Building With Heart

Iâ€™m Nalin, a 21-year-old engineer, builder, and relentless optimist. My story isnâ€™t just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about curiosity, grit, and a deep desire to make a difference.

As a kid, I was the one who took apart the family radio, not to break it, but to understand how it sang. That same curiosity drives me today: I want to know how things work, and more importantly, how they can work better for people.

Iâ€™ve faced my share of setbacksâ€”failed projects, bugs at 3am, ideas that didnâ€™t land. But every challenge has been a lesson in resilience. I donâ€™t give up. I iterate, I learn, and I come back stronger. I believe the best solutions come from listening first, then building with empathy and purpose.

What makes me different? Iâ€™m not just a problem-solverâ€”Iâ€™m a connector. I love bringing people together, mentoring new contributors, and making technology accessible to all. My open-source work isnâ€™t just about shipping code; itâ€™s about growing communities and empowering others to succeed.

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and engineering. Whether Iâ€™m leading a team, designing a feature, or debugging a gnarly issue, I bring energy, humor, and a human touch. I want my work to leave people better than I found them.

If youâ€™re looking for someone who combines technical depth with vision, resilience, and heartâ€”letâ€™s talk. Iâ€™m here to build things that matter, with people who care.
