# Test: Add Comprehensive Unit Tests for `getDirElementsRecursive` ([#1679](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/pull/1679))

## Purpose

This PR adds a complete set of unit tests for the `getDirElementsRecursive` helper function in `packages/helpers/src/testing.js`.  
The tests validate recursive directory traversal logic with correct handling of nested directories, empty folders, and mixed file/directory structures.

Resolves [Issue #1668](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/issues/1668).

---

## Key Changes

### Unit Tests

- Added new test file: `packages/helpers/test/getDirElementsRecursive.test.js`.
- Covered scenarios:
  - Recursive traversal of nested files and directories
  - Handling empty directories
  - Deeply nested hierarchies with multiple levels
  - Mixed file and folder structures
- Verified cross-platform path handling with `path.join`.
- Used `jest.mock('fs/promises')` for controlled filesystem simulation.

---

## Tests

- Added **comprehensive Jest coverage** for `getDirElementsRecursive`.
- Edge cases covered:
  - Empty folders
  - Mixed structures
  - Multi-level recursion
- Verified:
  - Output object shape (`type`, `name`, `path`, `children`)
  - Correct detection of files vs directories
  - Recursive child resolution

Run locally:

```bash
npm install --prefix packages/helpers
npx --prefix packages/helpers jest test/getDirElementsRecursive.test.js
```

All tests should pass.

## Technical Highlights

### Jest Mocking for Filesystem

Now uses `mockResolvedValue` for cleaner mocking instead of `mockImplementation`, improving readability and consistency:

```js
fs.readdir.mockResolvedValue([
  { name: "file1.txt", isDirectory: () => false, isFile: () => true },
  { name: "subdir", isDirectory: () => true, isFile: () => false },
]);
```

### Test File Cleanups (per feedback)

- Consolidated `require` statements at the top of the file.
- Removed duplicate imports (`path`, `getDirElementsRecursive`).
- Added both `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks with `jest.clearAllMocks()` for reliability.

---

## Reviews and Feedback Addressed

- **Imports:** Moved all `require` statements (`getDirElementsRecursive`, `path`) to the top of the file.
- **Mocking:** Replaced `mockImplementation` with `mockResolvedValue` for simpler mocks.
- **Test lifecycle:** Added `beforeEach` + `afterEach` to consistently clear mocks.

All feedback from @Adi-204 has been incorporated.
