# Test: Add Comprehensive Unit Tests for `getDirElementsRecursive` ([#1677](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/pull/1677))

## Purpose

This PR introduces a full suite of unit tests for the `getDirElementsRecursive` helper function in `packages/helpers/src/testing.js`.  
The tests validate recursive directory traversal logic, ensuring correct handling of nested directories, empty folders, and mixed file/directory structures.

This fully resolves [Issue #1668](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/issues/1668).

---

## Key Changes

### Unit Tests

- Added new test file: `test/getDirElementsRecursive.test.js`.
- Covered core scenarios:
  - Recursive traversal of files and directories.
  - Correct handling of empty directories.
  - Deeply nested folder structures with multiple levels.
- Validated cross-platform path handling with `path.join`.
- Mocked `fs.promises.readdir` using `jest` to simulate filesystem behavior.

---

## Tests

- Added **comprehensive Jest test coverage** for `getDirElementsRecursive`.
- Covered edge cases:
  - Empty directories
  - Mixed file/folder structures
  - Deeply nested hierarchies
- Verified correctness of:
  - Object structure (`type`, `name`, `path`, `children`)
  - Identification of `file` vs `directory`
  - Recursive child resolution

Run locally with:

```bash
npm install --prefix packages/helpers
npx --prefix packages/helpers jest test/getDirElementsRecursive.test.js
```
````

All tests should pass.

## Technical Highlights

### Jest Mocking for Filesystem

Simulated directory trees without touching the real filesystem:

```js
fs.readdir.mockImplementation(async (dir, opts) => {
  if (dir === "/root") {
    return [
      { name: "file1.txt", isDirectory: () => false, isFile: () => true },
      { name: "subdir", isDirectory: () => true, isFile: () => false },
    ];
  }
  return [];
});
```

Ensures deterministic and isolated tests across environments.
