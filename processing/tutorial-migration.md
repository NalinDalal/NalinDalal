# Migrating “Getting Started with Node.js” Tutorial to p5.js 2.x

**Issue:** [#837](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/837)
**Pull Request:** [p5.js-website PR #879](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/879)

## Problem

The tutorial was outdated and used p5.js 1.x conventions:

* Legacy APIs like `preload()`
* Old-style `setup()` and sketch structure
* External examples linked to p5.js 1.x CDN (broken under 2.0)

## Objective

* Migrate the tutorial to p5.js 2.x
* Replace `preload()` with modern `async/await` patterns
* Fork and update Web Editor examples to be 2.0-compatible
* Verify correctness of all examples locally

## Solution

* Rewrote sketches using `async function setup()`
* Replaced `preload()` with `await loadImage()` and similar asynchronous calls
* Used `p5.instanceMode` where necessary
* Verified behavior locally using `npm run dev`
* Updated CDN links in embedded examples to `p5.js@2.x`

## Technical Challenges

* Rebased feature branch onto upstream 2.0 branch without duplicating commits
* Resolved non-fast-forward merge errors using `--rebase`
* Ensured asynchronous loading didn't break existing sketch logic
