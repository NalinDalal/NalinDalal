# Auto-Link and Auto-Close Issues on PRs to Dev Branches (`dev-2.0`)

**Issue:** [#7975](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/7975)
**Pull Requests:**

- [p5.js PR #7989](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/7989)
- [p5.js-website PR #919](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/919)

## Problem

GitHubâ€™s built-in auto-close behavior (`Fixes #`, `Closes #`) only works for PRs merged into the **default branch**. This created issues:

- PRs into `2.0` or `dev-2.0` didn't auto-link or auto-close issues
- Contributors had to manually close referenced issues
- Example: [PR #7971](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/7971) failed to close [Issue #7905](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/7905)

## Objective

- Create a GitHub Action that runs when PRs are merged into `2.0` or `dev-2.0`
- Parse PR body for issue-closing keywords
- Automatically close referenced issues via GitHub API

## Solution

- Wrote `.github/workflows/auto-close-issues.yml` in both `p5.js` and `p5.js-website`
- Script parses PR descriptions and extracts issue references
- Sends POST requests to GitHub API to close those issues
- Uses secure `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication
- Logs warnings for malformed/missing issue references

## Outcome

- Issues auto-close on PR merges into non-default branches (like `dev-2.0`)
- No manual issue management needed by contributors
- Cleaner project boards and faster feedback loops

## Technical Challenges

- GitHub doesn't support this behavior natively for non-default branches
- Required manual parsing and API calls to close issues
- Handled edge cases like malformed PR descriptions, missing references, and multiple issue links

## Updates

so the engineers discussed among themselves
what they want or have approach in mind that an external repository must encapsulate the
script

so i asked the current pr to be merged right away and asked for updates on the
particular topic
