# Documenting the Difference Between `textWidth` and `fontWidth` in p5.js 2.0

## Background

In p5.js 2.0, a bug report was raised ([#7745](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/7745)) regarding the behavior of `textWidth(' ')` returning 0, whereas in p5.js 1.x it returned a positive value. This led to a discussion about the intended difference between `textWidth` and `fontWidth`, especially with respect to whitespace handling.

## Key Differences

- **`textWidth()`**: Returns the width of the smallest bounding box containing the specified text. It uses the `actualBoundingBoxLeft` and `actualBoundingBoxRight` properties from the browser's `TextMetrics` object. This is a "tight" measurement, focusing on the visible glyphs.
  - Leading and trailing whitespace may not contribute to the bounding box, so `textWidth(' ')` can return 0.
- **`fontWidth()`**: Returns the width of the text as measured by `measureText(string).width`. This is a "loose" measurement, including the advance width for all characters, including whitespace.
  - `fontWidth(' ')` will return the expected width for a space character.

## Example

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 100);
  textSize(32);
  let str = " x y ";
  console.log("textWidth:", textWidth(str));
  console.log("fontWidth:", fontWidth(str));
}
```

- `textWidth(' ')` → 0 (tight bounding box, no visible glyph)
- `fontWidth(' ')` → ~5 (advance width of space character)

## Why This Is Correct

- `textWidth` is designed to measure the actual visual bounding box, which may ignore leading/trailing whitespace if those characters do not produce visible glyphs.
- `fontWidth` measures the total advance width, including all whitespace, matching the behavior of most text layout engines.

## Documentation Update

- The documentation for both functions should clarify this distinction.
- Example code and explanation should be added to both references.
