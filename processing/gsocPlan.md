## Updates about GSoC 2026 - Org Application in Progress!

Hi everyone :sunflower:

If you’re interested in working on a project with Processing Foundation for the next GSoC, read on!

The deadlines for GSoC 2026 have been announced! Until February 3, we will be applying as an org. First, the org has to be accepted; then, the applications for contributors will open. For now, contributor applications are not open. I’ll update this post when that changes: so if you’re reading this, it is still true.

Once deadlines are announced, the first step will be for organizations, including PF, to apply. After GSoC program decides whether to accept our org, we will open applications.

If you’re interested in being a GSoC contributor, you can read through last year’s FAQ thread to have a better idea of what to expect when applications do open (at the end, there is also a summary of how proposals were evaluated).

You can also get involved by looking for “Good First Issues” on the repositories (including p5.js, p5.js-website, processing4). Before making any PR, please be sure to read the contributor guidelines carefully. Processing Foundation does not require PRs for applicants, and PRs (and other activity in online community spaces) that consistently ignore contribution and community guidelines can actually make your proposal less likely to succeed.

As in the previous year, any questions that you have about the process - please ask them here! All public questions will be answered. I’ll be back here every couple of weeks, and much more frequently (just like last year) during the application process!

Best,
Kit (PF GSoC org admin for 2025)

This year, unlike last year, we will welcome custom project proposals. So the ideas list will be there as a starting point, but it would not be meant as a limitation.
