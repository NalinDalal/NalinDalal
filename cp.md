# Competitive Programming & Codeforces Practice Guide

The idea of Codeforces and CP is to **solve problems in less time**. Right now, you have time — so give it a complete shot.  
Practice and practice and practice. Use **Gym section** to skill up.

- For **problem solving**, take tough problems and give enough time to think — don’t quit early.
- For **speed**, practice easy questions under time constraints (like solving `x` problems in `y` minutes).

## Levels of Practice

### 1. Beginner (Rating ~800–1200) - Month 1-2

Focus on implementing basic algorithms and understanding common topics:

- Loops, arrays, strings, sorting
- Recursion
- Bit manipulation
- Number Theory
- Prefix Sum

* 2 easy (CSES/CF 800–1200) → warm-up
* 1 medium (CF Div.2 A/B \~1200–1400) → grind
* 3-4 problems less than 1 hr
* Codeforces Div.3/Div.4 Contest live + Virtual Contest GYM
* LeetCode

### 2. Intermediate (Rating ~1200–1600) - Month 3-4

Cover popular topics like:

- Binary Search
- Number Theory
- 2 Pointers
- Prefix Sums
- Greedy Algorithms
- Introductory Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)

* CSES Graphs (basic BFS/DFS, shortest paths)
* CSES DP basics (Dice Combinations → Book Shop)
* Codeforces Div.2 contests (A–C focus)

### 3. Advanced (Rating 1600+) - Month 5-6

Focus more on **upsolving and analyzing contest problems**. Learn advanced algorithms:

- Segment Trees
- Fenwick Trees (BIT)
- Advanced DP
- Graphs & Trees
- Network Flows & Other Graph Algorithms

## Practice Guidelines

1. Practice — if stuck, think **up to 30 mins** before moving on. move on to editorials, read algo, then try to solve yourself.
2. Push yourself with problems **slightly above your level**.
3. Solve an **optimal number** of problems (200–400) instead of 2000–4000.
4. Solve problems that **feel hard** for you.

## Manual Training Method (ThemeCP)

1. **Determine your initial level** using the [level sheet]. Example: a 2300-rated coder starts at level 49.
2. Create your **ThemeCP at your level**:
   - Pick a random topic from the list.
   - Select 4 problems of increasing rating (e.g., 1700/1900/2100/2300).
3. Begin solving in order of difficulty.
4. If you get an **AK (4/4)** → increment level by 1.
   - Otherwise, decrement by 1.
   - Always **upsolve the easiest problem you didn’t solve**.
5. Repeat from Step 2. Take a short break and continue.
   - Use the **ThemeCP tracker** to log progress.
