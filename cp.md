# Competitive Programming & Codeforces Practice Guide

The idea of Codeforces and CP is to **solve problems in less time**. Right now, you have time — so give it a complete shot.  
Practice and practice and practice. Use **Gym section** to skill up.

- For **problem solving**, take tough problems and give enough time to think — don’t quit early.
- For **speed**, practice easy questions under time constraints (like solving `x` problems in `y` minutes).

## Levels of Practice

### 1. Beginner (Rating ~800–1200)

Focus on implementing basic algorithms and understanding common topics:

- Loops, arrays, strings, sorting
- Recursion
- Bit manipulation
- Number Theory
- Prefix Sum

### 2. Intermediate (Rating ~1200–1600)

Cover popular topics like:

- Binary Search
- Number Theory
- 2 Pointers
- Prefix Sums
- Greedy Algorithms
- Introductory Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS)

### 3. Advanced (Rating 1600+)

Focus more on **upsolving and analyzing contest problems**. Learn advanced algorithms:

- Segment Trees
- Fenwick Trees (BIT)
- Advanced DP
- Graphs & Trees
- Network Flows & Other Graph Algorithms

## Practice Guidelines

1. Practice — if stuck, think **up to 30 mins** before moving on.
2. Solve problems with **editorials**.
3. Push yourself with problems **slightly above your level**.
4. Solve an **optimal number** of problems (200–400) instead of 2000–4000.
5. Don’t get stuck for long hours — learn and move forward.
6. Solve problems that **feel hard** for you.

## Manual Training Method (ThemeCP)

1. **Determine your initial level** using the [level sheet]. Example: a 2300-rated coder starts at level 49.
2. Create your **ThemeCP at your level**:
   - Pick a random topic from the list.
   - Select 4 problems of increasing rating (e.g., 1700/1900/2100/2300).
   - Tools: TLE bot (Discord).
3. Begin solving in order of difficulty.
4. If you get an **AK (4/4)** → increment level by 1.
   - Otherwise, decrement by 1.
   - Always **upsolve the easiest problem you didn’t solve**.
5. Repeat from Step 2. Take a short break and continue.
   - Use the **ThemeCP tracker** to log progress.
